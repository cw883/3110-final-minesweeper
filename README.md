## Description

Our project is a Minesweeper game where the user is able to play the game
with a ruleset of their choice. In normal minesweeper, when you click on the grid, it will reveal the number of mines that are directly adjacent to the square. However, with a custom ruleset, it will display the number of mines in other directions (diagonal, the directions that a knight in chess would do, a cross, etc.). Users can also select a variety of fun UI themes. 

The game can be played with a grid of dimensions between 4 and 12 on each side with between 4 and 12 mines. Click on all the non-mine grid squares to win the game!
