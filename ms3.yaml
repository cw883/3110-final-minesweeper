# Write a short, attention-grabbing description of your project.
desc: >
  Our project is a Minesweeper game where the user is able to play the game
  with twists of their choice. You can choose between many different rulesets.
  Typically, in normal minesweeper, when you click on the grid, it will reveal
  the number of mines that are directly adjacent to the square. However,
  with the custom ruleset, it will display the number of mines in other directions
  (diagonal, the directions that a knight in chess would do, a cross). Users
  can also select between a variety of fun themes that changes the color of
  the UI in the home screen. 

  The game can be played with a grid of size 4x4 to 12x12 with between 4 and
  12 mines. Click on all the non mine grids to win the game. One thing to
  note is that you should click the edges of the grid and start button
  to activate them.
